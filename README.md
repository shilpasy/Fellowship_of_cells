# Fellowship_of_cells
We will look at standard preprocesing workflow of sc-RNAseq data, normalization and clustering.
In this tutorial, we will be looking at a dataset of PBMCs. PBMCs are like the army of immune cells that live in our blood and fight off any invaders like viruses or bacteria.
The tutorial is from Seurat guided Clustering of scRNA-seq data.
