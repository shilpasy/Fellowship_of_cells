In this tutorial, we will explore the fundamental setup and perform clustering analysis for single-cell RNA sequencing using Seurat. This comprehensive tutorial aims to assist beginners in understanding the topic more effectively, employing fun analogies where possible.

We will embark on a step-by-step journey, covering crucial stages such as standard pre-processing workflow, normalization, feature selection, scaling, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and the subsequent visualization and annotation of clusters. 

Our specific dataset focuses on Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC), often described as the fearless immune cell army that resides within our bloodstream. These remarkable cells diligently safeguard our bodies, acting as defenders against potential invaders such as viruses and bacteria.

To make the learning experience more enjoyable and relatable, we have infused some fun analogies inspired by the LOTR universe.

So, let's get started and unravel the mysteries of Seurat-guided clustering for scRNA-seq data!
